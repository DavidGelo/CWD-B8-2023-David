                <p class="responsive flow-text yellow-text text-lighten-2">One common flaw we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support for truly responsive text. While elements on the page resize fluidly, text still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, for text heavy pages, we've created a class that fluidly scales text size and line-height to optimize readability for the user. Line length stays between 45-80 characters and line height scales to be larger on smaller screens.

                    <br><br>To see Flow Text in action, slowly resize your browser and watch the size of this text body change! Use the button above to toggle off/on flow-text to see the difference!</p>
